### Technologies and Tools

* **SQL**: For data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
* **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: The primary tool used to execute SQL queries and manage the database.

### Key Findings

The SQL queries address the following key questions and provide insights into the layoff data:

* **Total layoffs over time**: Identifying trends in layoffs by year and month.
* **Top companies with layoffs**: Ranking companies by the total number of layoffs.
* **Industry impact**: Analyzing which industries were most affected by layoffs.
* **Geographical breakdown**: Examining layoff numbers by country and location.
* **Highest percentage of layoffs**: Identifying companies with the most severe layoff events (highest percentage of their workforce laid off).
